To perform sentiment analysis on a given text using a pre-trained AI model, you can follow the code snippet [here]() 

Make sure to replace 'path_to_model.h5' with the actual path to your pre-trained model. This code snippet preprocesses the input text by removing stopwords and special characters, then uses the pre-trained model to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The predicted sentiment is printed as the output.
