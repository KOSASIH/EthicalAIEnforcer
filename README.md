# App Code 

To perform sentiment analysis on a given text using a pre-trained AI model, you can follow the code snippet [here](app.py) 

Make sure to replace 'path_to_model.h5' with the actual path to your pre-trained model. This code snippet preprocesses the input text by removing stopwords and special characters, then uses the pre-trained model to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The predicted sentiment is printed as the output.

# Calculate Fairness Metrics

[This code snippet](calculate_fairness_metrics.py) demonstrates the usage of the fairness evaluation metric. It defines a function calculate_fairness_metrics that takes a dataset and the predictions made by an AI model as inputs. The dataset should contain the true labels and the indices of the protected group. The function calculates and returns three fairness metrics: disparate impact, equal opportunity difference, and statistical parity difference.

To use the code, you need to provide the dataset and predictions as input arguments to the calculate_fairness_metrics function. In the usage example, a sample dataset and predictions are provided. The function then calculates the fairness metrics and prints them as output.

# Generate Synthetics Data 

[This code snippet](generate_synthetic_data.py) demonstrates how to generate synthetic data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It takes the original dataset as an input and generates a specified number of synthetic data samples that resemble the characteristics of the original data.

To use this code, you need to replace the original_data variable with your own dataset. The original_data should be a numpy array where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature.

You also need to specify the num_samples variable to determine the number of synthetic data samples to generate.

After running the code, the synthetic_data variable will contain the generated synthetic data samples. You can then use this synthetic data for training your AI model.
